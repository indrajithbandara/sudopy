# sudopy
Little script to make invoking a command as superuser a bit easier on Windows.

# Installation

1. Install Python3.6. Make sure you choose the option to add a PATH variable
    for Python, and that you install for all users.
2. Stick `sudo.py` in some directory included in your PATH variable. For ease,
    you could stick it in `system32` as it is technically an administrative
    utility ~~insert rant about security blah blah I don't need to hear it.~~
3. Run from a command line or from the run dialog: `sudo cmd.exe` to test it
    out.
4. Go reward yourself after a hard days work by spending 4 hours getting
    Node.js to install or something.
